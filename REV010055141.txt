AFFIDAVIT

I, Vykuntam Kesavulu S/o Kesavalu, aged about 63 years R/o Nallamadugttla Village, Chandrasekharapuram Mandal, Prakasam District. do hereby solemnly affirm and sincerely state on oath as follows:

    1. I am the petitioner herein and as such I am well acquainted with the facts of the case.


    2. I humbly submit that the present writ petition is aggrieved by the action on the part of the respondents 'in not considering my representations Dt. 'l"l.0'1.2022 and 27.01.2023 for removal of encroachments comprised in Sy.no -130/12 of Nallamadugula Village, Chandrasekharapuram Mandal, Prakasam District made by the 6th Respondent as illegal, arbitrary and unjust.

    3. It is submitted that petitioner is resident of Nallamadugula Village, Chandrasekharapuram Mandal, Prakasam District. petitioner's ancestors have constructed Lord Sri Rama Temple with an extent of Ac 0.38 cents in Sy.no 130/12 of Nallamadugula Village. The entire extent of the Sy.no 130/12 is Ac 4.20 cents. Recently we n'oticed unauthorized building being constructed by the 6* Respondent viithout permission of the °5*'Respondent gram panchayat. Furiher'he'is trying dug the land of the temple and encroaching the government and endowment land.

    4. It is further submitted that as matter stood thus, earlier petitioner made representation dated 11.02.2022 to the respondents requesting to remove encroachments in the subject survey number. In reply to that 2"d Respondent has addressed a letter to the 3'd and 4* Respondent to enquire into the matter and take action accordingly to law. Despite of that 3'd and 4* Respondents has not taken action so far and encroachments are still subsisting in the subject matter. recently petitioner submitted anohter representation dated 27.01.2023 to 2n* respondent to take action against the encroachments of the 6"' Respondent. It 'is iiirther represented that if the building is completed in the encroached site, it may cause religious tensions in the

.."-,<-,...,i: '". ,.,,"..	, .,..,;

village. for which there is no response from the respondents. Several times petitioner requested the Respondents to issue riotice to the 6* Respondent and further requested to enquire whether any permission wanted for construction of the building for which Respondents has not taken any action under the law. Further it is duty cast upon the official Respondents to consider the representations and demolish the illegal structures vested upon the government land, In the above said site 6* Respondent has erected the building and constructing it in war footing manner.



    5. I further submit that I submitted repeated representations to respondents with a request to take action for removal of illegal and unauthorized encroachments on poramboke lands which vested on gram panchayat. My recent representation is Dt. 27.01.2023 was duly received by official respondents, but they have not initiated any action thereon. Inaction on the part of official respondents on my aforesaid representations is illegal, irregular, arbitrary and violative of provisions of Relevant revenue laws by which encroachments of lands in, the state of Andhra Pradesh is governed. In fitness of things respondents l to 5 ought to have demolished the illegal construction of 6* respondent as constructed in excess of permissible area of construction. Hence this writ petition. If the respondents are allowed to proceed with encroachment, I will be put to irreparable loss and hardship. The said action is illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional.











    6. In the circumstances stated above, the petitioner has no efficacious alternative remedy, except to approach this Hon'b1e Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner has not filed any writ petition, suit or other proceedings for the relief or relieves sought herein.



I, therefore pray that this Hon'ble court may be pleased to issue a writ, order or direction more particularly one in the nature of Writ of Mandamus declaring the action of the respondents 2 to 5 in not considering petitioner representation Dt. 27.01.2023 and 11.02.2023 for removal of illegal and unauthorized encroachments comprised in Sy.no 130/12 of Nallamadugula Village, Chandrasekharapuram Mandal, Prakasam District made by the 6th Respondent in spite of repeated representations submitted by petitioner is illegal, irregular, arbitrary and violative of provisions of relevant Revenue laws and offends Art, 14 and 21 of Constitution of India and Consequently direct the respondents 2 to 5 to demolish illegal and unauthorized Encroachment of the ñ* Respondent and pass such other order or orders as this Hon'ble court may deems fit and proper in the circumstances of the case.







I further humbly pray that this Hon'ble court may be pleased to direct the

respondent 2 to 5 to consider the representation dated Dt. 27.01.2023 and 11.02.2023 submitted by the petitioner, for removal of illegal and unauthorized encroachment in Sy.no 130/12 of Nallamadugula Village, Chandrasekharapuram Mandal, Prakasam
